# BioBot Game

### Background and Features
This Program, "BioBot", was created by Timothy Lee for a Java project back in 2014. It features a tile-based game where the user commands a rover on Mars. The rover must avoid running into lava pits or dust storms while gathering resources all over the map. The rover's visibility, movement speed, and energy is limited. The rover can acquire more resources for upgrades. Resources take the form of crystal & potions and require the player to speedily answer Biology multiple-choice questions to determine the amount of resources collected. Resources can be sold on the exchange market at fluctuating rates which are influenced by the resources the player sold previously. Some bonuses and easter eggs are available. The game supports a simplified save and load function. The game also has a local leaderboard and instructions in-game.
